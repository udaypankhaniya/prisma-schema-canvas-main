Submitting Pull Requests
To contribute code, follow these steps:

Fork the Repository:

Fork the prisma-schema-canvas-main repository to your GitHub account.


Clone and Branch:

Clone your fork:git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/prisma-schema-canvas-main.git
cd prisma-schema-canvas-main


Create a feature branch:git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name




Make Changes:

Follow the Code Guidelines.
Ensure your changes align with the project‚Äôs goals (e.g., improving the visual schema editor or adding new features).


Test Your Changes:

Run tests (if available) to ensure your changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality.
Test locally with npm run dev to verify the app works as expected.


Commit and Push:

Write clear, concise commit messages (e.g., Add support for schema import validation).
Push your branch:git push origin feature/your-feature-name




Open a Pull Request:

Go to the repository and create a pull request from your branch.
Use the pull request template (if available) and include:
A description of your changes.
Reference to any related issues (e.g., Fixes #123).
Screenshots or videos for UI changes.


Ensure all CI checks (e.g., linting, tests) pass.


Respond to Feedback:

Once approved, your changes will be merged!



Development Setup
Prerequisites

Node.js: Version 18.x or higher (recommended: 20.x for Vercel compatibility).
npm: Version 8.x or higher.
Git: For cloning and managing the repository.
A code editor like VS Code with the following extensions (optional):
ESLint
Prettier
TypeScript



Setting Up the Project

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/udaypankhaniya/prisma-schema-canvas-main.git
cd prisma-schema-canvas-main


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Configure Environment Variables:

Copy .env.example to .env.local (if available) and fill in any required variables (e.g., DATABASE_URL for Prisma integration).
If no .env.example exists, check the documentation for required variables.



Running the Project

Start the development server:
npm run dev


Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified by Vite) to view the app.

Make changes and test in your browser.

Build for production:
npm run build


Preview the production build:
npm run preview



Testing

Run linting to check code style:
npm run lint


If tests are available (e.g., using Jest or Vitest), run:
npm test

(Note: If no test suite exists, consider adding tests for your contributions.)

For UI changes, manually test the drag-and-drop interface, schema preview, and export functionality to ensure they work as expected.


Code Guidelines

Code Style:

Follow the existing ESLint and Prettier configurations (see .eslintrc and .prettierrc).
Use TypeScript for type safety.
Write clean, modular React components using functional components and hooks.


File Structure:

Place new components in src/components/ or appropriate subfolders (e.g., src/components/ui/ for UI components).
Add new features to relevant directories (e.g., src/features/ if applicable).


Commits:

Use descriptive commit messages (e.g., fix: resolve schema export bug or feat: add dark mode toggle).
Follow conventional commits if enforced by the project.


Dependencies:

Avoid adding new dependencies unless necessary. If needed, justify their inclusion in your pull request.
Ensure compatibility with existing dependencies (see package.json).


Prisma Integration:

If contributing to schema-related features, ensure compatibility with Prisma‚Äôs schema syntax (.prisma files).
Test schema generation and import/export functionality thoroughly.
Refer to Prisma‚Äôs documentation for schema best practices.
